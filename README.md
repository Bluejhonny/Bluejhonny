### Hi there 👋
I'm Jhonny! I'm a trainee developer.

🌋 I'm currently improving my knowledge of the  MERN Stack (NodeJS, ExpressJS, MongoDB, React).

👍 I’m looking to collaborate with teams with large or small projects where I can apply my knowledge and expertise 

🌟 I am looking for a job as a back end developer in the mern or pern stack.
